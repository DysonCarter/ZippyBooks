        <h2>Home Page</h2>
        <p>The home page contains the list of all books within our catalog (Even if they are out of stock). To check if your book is in stock and to add to cart visit the <a href=search.php >Search Page.</a></p>
        <h2>Admin Page</h2>
        <p>If you are an Admin, Log in to handle book database. Includes adding books to catalog, deleting books from catalog, and updating price from existing books to catalog.</p>
        <h2>Search Page</h2>
        <p>Type in the book you want to buy and hit search. From there if your book is available you can add it to your cart with the click of a button.</p>
        <h4>Why is my book in the catalog but not showing up in the search?</h4>
        <p>If your book is on our <a href=prj.php>Home Page</a> but not appearing in search try narrowing the title down to one key word. If your book still does not appear it may be out of stock.</p>
        <h2>Cart Page</h2>
        <p>Here you can view all of the books added to your shopping cart. If you had a change of heart you can clear the shopping cart and add different books. If everything looks good you can checkout, the database will update the amount of stock for each book, and we will thank you for your purchase.</p>
